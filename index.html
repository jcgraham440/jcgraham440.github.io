  <p>Johnny was a school boy, when he heard his first Beatles song
     Love me do I think it was and from there it didn't take him long
     Bought himself a guitar, played it every night
     Now he's in a rock-n-roll outfit and everything's alright

     Don't you know? 
  </p>

  <p>Johnny died one night, died in his bed
     Bottle of whisky sleeping tablets by his head
     Johnny's life passed him by like a warm summer day
     If you listen to the wind you can still hear him play

     Don't you know? Don't you know?
     Don't you know that you are a shooting star
     And all the world will love you just as long, as long as you ARE a shooting star!
